# about-me

#a. What did you do before GA/WDI?
Before coming to GA for WDI I was working in a medical field with a small specialist practice along with spending time as a volunteer EMT/Firefighter. The practice was in a building phase and was in much need of help to get themselves going. I was originally hired as a Medical Assistant to support the providers in their day to day activities. After about a year into this job the manager was let go and I, along with another MA, took on the roles of managment to take care of issues in the practice. During the following 3 years I was heavily relied upon to fix problems, help train people in jobs, and provide support to providers in what was expected to get done at the end of the day/week. At mid point last year I was fed up with doing the extra work and not being appreciated for the work. I left the job and then pursued something that would work to my strengths with technology and computers. I reached out to a long time friend who pointed out to look into coding, at which point I took an online class that was rather interesting, but I didn't feel was able to teach  me enough. So that is what brought me to GA.

#b. Outcomes support I need:
I would need great networking connections for jobs/companies out there in the tech world here in Denver. I would like to have a solid, steady job that is reliable.

#c. Day 1 Goals:
Project Goal(s): Be able to develop and design any ideas that come to my head with full competency, ie: my own personal portfolio website, website for a personal company idea, a website that looks and moves like a car.

Personal Goal(s): Network with everyone here so that when in future we need to find things (jobs) or need help you know people who have a great skill set. This could also lead to a great development business that would showcase skills that would/should dominate the tech market (Denver in particular).

#d. 2 truths and a lie

2. I am on social media everyday for at least 4 hours

# Type of Company I want to work for
Just to get my foot in the door and really start to get comfortable in the industry I could go just about anywhere. There are some caveat to that however, I would not like to go into a big corporate job. Even though the pay is great I would not like to be a part of that structure at all. I really enjoy working with people whom I get along with which fits more into the small startup/mid level companies. I think a great way to start would be in an Agency setting where I could learn tricks of the trade and get up to speed just making websites and apps all the time.

# Role for Me
I really can embrace both sides of the developer role in more of a Full Stack kind of thing, but I like to work on my weaknesses more than divy to my strengths. Which means that doing more backend work would really help me out as the front end is where I really do well currently.
