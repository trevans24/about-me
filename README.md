# about-me

#a. What did you do before GA/WDI?
Before coming to GA for WDI I was working in a medical field with a small specialist practice along with spending time as a volunteer EMT/Firefighter. The practice was in a building phase and was in much need of help to get themselves going. I was originally hired as a Medical Assistant to support the providers in their day to day activities. After about a year into this job the manager was let go and I, along with another MA, took on the roles of managment to take care of issues in the practice. During the following 3 years I was heavily relied upon to fix problems, help train people in jobs, and provide support to providers in what was expected to get done at the end of the day/week. At mid point last year I was fed up with doing the extra work and not being appreciated for the work. I left the job and then pursued something that would work to my strengths with technology and computers. I reached out to a long time friend who pointed out to look into coding, at which point I took an online class that was rather interesting, but I didn't feel was able to teach  me enough. So that is what brought me to GA.

#b. Outcomes support I need:
I would need great networking connections for jobs/companies out there in the tech world here in Denver. I would like to have a solid, steady job that is reliable.

#c. Day 1 Goals:
Project Goal(s): Be able to develop and design any ideas that come to my head with full competency, ie: my own personal portfolio website, website for a personal company idea, a website that looks and moves like a car.

Personal Goal(s): Network with everyone here so that when in future we need to find things (jobs) or need help you know people who have a great skill set. This could also lead to a great development business that would showcase skills that would/should dominate the tech market (Denver in particular).
